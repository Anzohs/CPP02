# CPP02

This repository contains the exercises and solutions for the **CPP Module 02** project from [42 School](https://www.42.fr/). The project builds upon the concepts introduced in previous modules, focusing on polymorphism, operator overloading, and other advanced C++ features.

## Project Overview

The **CPP Module 02** introduces the following key concepts in C++:

- Ad-hoc polymorphism.
- Operator overloading.
- The use of canonical form for classes.
- Further exploration of memory management.


## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
- **CPP02/**
  - `ex00/` - Exercise 00
  - `ex01/` - Exercise 01
  - `ex02/` - Exercise 02
  - `ex03/` - Exercise 03


Each exercise is self-contained and includes:

- A `main.cpp` file to test the implementation.
- Additional `.hpp` and `.cpp` files for the exercise requirements.
- A `Makefile` to compile the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A working C++ compiler (e.g., `clang++` or `g++`).
- Basic understanding of C++ programming concepts.

### Compilation

Navigate to the exercise directory and run the `Makefile` to compile the program:

```sh
cd ex00
make
```

This will generate an executable file in the same directory.
To clean compiled files, use:

```sh
make clean
```

To clean all generated files, including executables, use:
```sh
make fclean
```

To recompile the project, use:
```sh
make re
```

### Running the Program
After compilation, run the executable:
```sh
./program_name
```

Replace **program_name** with the actual name of the executable generated by the **Makefile**.


## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn:

  -The principles of ad-hoc polymorphism in C++.
  -How to overload operators for custom class behaviors.
  -Proper implementation of the canonical form in C++ classes.
  -Advanced memory management techniques.
